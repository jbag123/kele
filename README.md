Bloc's API provides an external facing JSON Web Token authorized gateway to the Bloc application. You can access it via cURL, but an API client can manage the low-level details of making requests and handling responses. Build the Kele API Client to provide easy access to and use of the student endpoints of Bloc's API.

This is a basic Ruby Gem that allows authorization with JSON Web Tokens. 

It calls an API using a client and allows you to view and update Bloc profiles and schedules.

Postman is an excellent resource to test your API calls with.
