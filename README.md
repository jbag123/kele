Bloc's API provides an external facing JSON Web Token authorized gateway to the Bloc application. You can access it via cURL, but an API client can manage the low-level details of making requests and handling responses. Build the Kele API Client to provide easy access to and use of the student endpoints of Bloc's API.

This is a basic Ruby Gem that allows authorization with JSON Web Tokens. 

It calls an API using a client and allows you to view and update Bloc profiles and schedules.

Postman is an excellent resource to test your API calls with.

Ruby Gems can be used to extend or modify functionality in Ruby applications. Commonly theyâ€™re used to distribute reusable functionality that is shared with other Rubyists for use in their applications and libraries. Some gems provide command line utilities to help automate tasks and speed up your work.
